# Machine Learning Fundamentals

### Prerequisites (present)

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) 
* [Python 3.6 or greater](https://www.python.org/) 
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)

### Notebooks

Part I - Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors.ipynb

We explored the problem of predicting the optimal price to list an AirBnB rental for based on the price of similar listings on the site.

Part II - Evaluating Model Performance.ipynb

We learned how to test our machine learning models using basic cross validation and different as MAE, MSE and RMSE.

Part III - Multivariate K-Nearest Neighbor.ipynb

We prepared the data to be able to use more features, trained a few models using multiple features, and evaluated the different performance tradeoffs
